I have made them just as written, wonderfull, moist, delicate flavor...then the next time, I did not have sour cream so used vanilla yogurt and added toffee pieces- still good.  I have made them as cupcakes and they rise very nicely and stay moist."

I only made substitutions for things I did not have on hand such as making my own ranch dressing mix, replacing stewed tomatoes with diced tomatoes with onion powder, and using chili hot beans instead of the drained pinto beans and can of green chilies. If I had all of the ingredients on hand, I wouldn&#39;t have changed anything."

I&#39;ve been looking for lots of recipes with lemons in them, and stumbled upon this one yesterday after I received an abundance of fresh lemons and grapefruits from someone in Arizona. I decided to make this and it turned out really nice and looked so pretty -- just make sure you grease/flour your pan well! Some of the bottom got stuck, but I was able to piece it back together. My boyfriend really liked this bread and said &#34;This loaf will get eaten in no time!&#34; It has a nice heavy pound cake consistency, and the glaze on top tastes great."
